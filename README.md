# Farm Calculator

## About Farm Calculator

This is a project I made for my computer programming class using C++.
This project was created for the second lab of my class and
follows exactly what my professor asked to be designed. I am
limited on the methods and techniques I can use based on what we 
have covered in our class textbook.

The instructions were to create a calculator that will take the
total farm area in acres, the number of vegertables to be planted,
the seed cost per acre, plantation cost per acre, fertilizing cost
per acre, labor cost per acre, and the vegetable selling cost per
acre. The program will then calculate the total revenue and display
your proft/loss from farming.
